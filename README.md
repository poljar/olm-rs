# olm-rs

This project is dedicated towards creating a safe wrapper for [libolm](https://git.matrix.org/git/olm/about/) in Rust.

Matrix room for discussion: *[#olm-rs:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#olm-rs:matrix.org)*

### Building

`libolm` is compiled and statically linked on building `olm-sys` - so no further setup is required.
Please note however that `libolm` still needs `libstdc++` on your system (and it should already be there).
