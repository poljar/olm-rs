# Changelog for version 0.4.0

* this project is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license for better integration with the wider Matrix ecosystem
* fixed bug in `inbound_group_sessions`, where `session_is_verified` would return the inverted result
* this project now depends on a newer version of `olm-sys`, that does not depend on `bindgen` for building anymore, significantly reducing build time


### Contributors

Thank you to all the previous contributors for agreeing to relicense their code for this release!
