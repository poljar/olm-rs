# Changelog for version 0.2

* fixes issues with internal memory management that would result in a SIGSEGV when using the library outside of trivial test cases
* drastically reduces the amount of `unsafe` blocks, to exclusively where they are necessary
* `OlmUtility::ed25519_verify_utf8_msg` doesn't require mutability anymore for the `signature` parameter
