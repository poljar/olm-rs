# Changelog for version 2.0.1

This release fixes crashes due to invalid memory allocation in `OlmInboundGroupSession::decrypt(…)` and `OlmPkDecryption::decrypt(…)` on receiving ciphertext with invalid base64 coding. This could theoretically be exploited in Matrix client applications to facilitate a remote denial of service attack, so please update!

### Contributors

Thanks a lot to Denis Kasak for finding and fixing these vulnerabilities.
