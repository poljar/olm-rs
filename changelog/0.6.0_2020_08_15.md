# Changelog for version 0.6.0

* Adds bindings for the SAS and PK parts of `libolm`
* `olm-sys` crate has been bumped to v0.2.0, now allowing for dynamic linking to `libolm`

### Internal changes

* Fuzzing effort has been extended to `olm-rs::pk`
* the project now has active continuous integration
* the internal `getrandom` function now requires requested buffers to be encapsulated in the `Zeroizing` type, which zeroes out the buffer on deallocation

### Contributors

A huge thank you to poljar, for implementing `olm-rs::sas` and `olm-rs::sas`. They are co-maintainer of this library now.

Additionally a huge thank you and warm welcome to new contributor Nym Seddon, who made multiple bug fixes and code quality improvements, and on top of that revitalised the fuzzing effort for this library.
