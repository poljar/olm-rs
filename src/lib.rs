//! This is a wrapper for [`libolm`](https://git.matrix.org/git/olm/about/).
//! It exposes all original functionality, split into task oriented modules.
//!
//! This wrapper takes care of memory allocation for you, so all functions
//! in the original library exposing the buffer length of certain read/write
//! buffers (and similar functionality) are not exposed by this wrapper.
//!
//! Random number generation is also handled internally and hence there are no
//! function arguments for supplying random data.
//!
//! String arguments will vary in ownership requirements when being provided as a
//! function argument. This is because `libolm` will sometimes mutate this data and
//! sometimes won't. To avoid breaking the ownership model, full ownership is required
//! for the former case.
//!
//! All errors of the type `NOT_ENOUGH_RANDOM` and `OUTPUT_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` from
//! `libolm` that are encountered result in a panic, as they are unrecoverably fatal.
//! Similarly the output from `libolm` is assumed to be trusted, except for encryption
//! functions. If the string output from any other function is not properly encoded
//! as UTF-8, a panic will occur as well.
//! In case a function can panic, it is annotated as such in the documentation.
//!
//! All panics can be considered unreachable, they are documented however for the
//! purpose of transparency.
